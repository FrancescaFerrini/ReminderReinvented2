## Mode of use
When you open the app, you are on the main screen, which is like the command center for all your reminders. Here 
you can see how many reminders you have in total, those that are due and those for the next day. It's like 
having a quick summary of everything you need to do.
If you want to add a new reminder, just click the "+" button in the upper right corner. It will take you to a 
screen where you can enter the title of the reminder, notes, and select the date and time you want to be 
reminded. When you have everything ready, click "Save" and your reminder will be added to the list.
Then there is today's reminders screen. This is like having a to-do list specific to the day. Here you can see 
the reminders you have for today. If you want to delete one of these reminders because, for example, you have 
already completed that task, you can do so by simply sliding the item to the left and clicking "Delete."
When you have finished checking today's reminders, you can return to the main screen to get an overview of 
everything.
